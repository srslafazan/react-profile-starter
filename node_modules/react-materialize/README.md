Material design components for react, powered by [materializecss](http://materializecss.com/)

[![Build
Status](https://travis-ci.org/react-materialize/react-materialize.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/react-materialize/react-materialize)

Get started
===========

You'll have to load `materialize.css` and `materialize.js` globally in the page.

CommonJS
--------

```
$ npm install react-materialize

var Button = require('react-materialize').Button;

// with ES6 modules
import {Button, Card, Row, Col} from 'react-materialize';

```

Docs && Examples
---------

See [documentation](https://react-materialize.github.io) for live examples.

How does it compare to X.Y.Z?
=============================

The main goal of this project is to provide react component for
[materializecss](https://materializecss.com), at the current stage, I am
trying to implement all possible widgets that are supported by materializecss.
Please create an issue on github if you find you desired component is not
available.

There are other material design components for react.js, e.g. [material-ui](http://material-ui.com/),
which is more mature and popular than this one.
The main advantage of this project over e.g. material-ui is that it provides a
grid system similar to react-bootstrap.
